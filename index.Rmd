# Preface {-}

>Reproducibility—the ability to recompute results—and replicability—the chances other experimenters will achieve a consistent result—are two foundational characteristics of successful scientific research [@RN20918].

This volume is written in **Markdown**, and includes all analysis code employed in the study, providing a means for others to reproduce (exactly) those results discussed and expounded upon in the following chapters. The reproducible nature of this undertaking provides a means for others to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components of this study [@RN20915;@RN20916;@RN20917], which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge. Typology is the topic of this particular undertaking, and typological assignments often provide the requisite foundation for many of the assumptions, inferences, and interpretations that archaeologists regularly make. Diagnostic types---whether functional, decorative, morphological, or chronological [@RN20847]---are of considerable import in formulating archaeological interpretations. There has been no shortage of studies related to discussion of interobserver error in the assignment of archaeological types [@RN20922;@RN20921;@RN20920;@RN20919], and while the lack of consistency in the application of types among investigators is recognized as problematic, it is expected that the lack of consistency may be even more pronounced at the level of the type-variety.

Diagnostic artifact types provide the analytical foundation upon which much of our knowledge of the past is based. The focus of this particular study lies one level of abstraction beneath that of the type, on the many previously-defined type-varieties for Gary dart points. Given the ubiquity of Gary dart points, and the wide range of morphological variability in the type, it is not at all surprising that in at least one instance, a type-variety (_var. Beaver Tail Stem_) [@RN20895, 12-18] was posited seven years before the formal definition of the Gary dart point was advanced [@RN5066].

This exploratory study of linear metrics includes those Gary dart point type-varieties advanced at the Poverty Point, Cooper, and Means sites, providing the requisite analytical foundation needed to outline a basic archaeological epistemology for the Gary type. Further work will be needed to expand upon this study, which provides a basic data-driven approach to assigning the previously-posited type-varities. This effort does not delve into the various _**sub-type-varieties**_ (i.e., _Camden subgroup A_, _Camden subgroup B_), as it it focused only upon those type-varieties that are no more than one level of abstraction below that of the Gary dart point. A subsequent geometric morphometric study will aid in testing those hypotheses advanced by this exploratory study, while others will require additional data collection to include those Gary dart points from the George C. Davis (TX), Jaketown (MS), Miller (TX), Yarbrough (TX), Lake George (MS), and Scott (OK) sites.

I extend my gratitude to the Poverty Point World Heritage Site, and The University Museum in the J. William Fulbright College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Arkansas. Personal thanks go to Diana Greenlee and Mary C. Suter for their help and guidance regarding permissions and access to the collections. Additional thanks to Jared S. Pebworth and Ernest Gann for their assistance aggregating the Gary dart points from the collections, and with locating and sorting through the various associated site records from the Cooper and Means sites.

This volume enlists a variety of tools from the [Open Review Toolkit](https://www.openreviewtoolkit.org/), and some of the code provided for bookdown following in the steps of [Ben Marwick](https://benmarwick.github.io/bookdown-ort/). I extend my gratitude to all who contribute comments and constructive criticisms throughout the development and maturation of this project.
